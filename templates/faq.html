			<!-- <li>
				<h4>What is this built with?</h4>				
				<p>Gumroad is built on top of Google's App Engine and uses a lovely combination of HTML/CSS/Javascript for front-end stuff and Python for back-end stuff. There was no Photoshop involved in the process of building Gumroad - except for the favicon! We use <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payments and <a href="http://letscrate.com/">Crate</a> for hosting files.</p>
			</li> -->

			<li>
				<h4>What can I charge per link?</h4>				
				<p>Each link can be as little as $0.99 and as much as $999. Feel limited? <a href="mailto:hi@gumroad.com">Email us</a>.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h4>What is Gumroad's cut?</h4>				
				<p>Simple. It's 5% + $0.30 for each transaction. We're working hard to get this lower.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4>How do I get paid?</h4>				
				<p>A PayPal deposit at the end of every month. We are looking into alternatives.</p>
			</li>						
			
			<li>
				<h4>Why is this FAQ so short?</h4>				
				<p>We believe that with simple products come short FAQs. Please <a href="mailto:hi@gumroad.com">send us an email</a> if you have a question that isn't answered here.</p>

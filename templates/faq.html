		<h3>FAQ:</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>What is this built with?</h4>				
				<p>Gumroad is built on top of Google's App Engine and uses a lovely combination of HTML/CSS/Javascript for front-end stuff and Python for back-end stuff. There was no Photoshop involved in the process of building Gumroad - except for the favicon! We use <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payments and <a href="http://letscrate.com/">Crate</a> for hosting files.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h4>What can I charge per link?</h4>				
				<p>Each link must be at least $0.99 and can go up to $999. If you need something else, please <a href="mailto:hi@gumroad.com">send us an email</a>.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h4>What is Gumroad's cut?</h4>				
				<p>Simple. It's a flat 5%.</p>
				<p>We also take $0.30 from each card transaction to cover Credit Card interchange fees.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4>How do I get paid?</h4>				
				<p>We use PayPal to pay our users. You get paid at the end of every month. However, we are looking into - and will definitely implement - other alternatives.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h4>What's with the name?</h4>				
				<p>I had the domain. No, seriously. I think a lot of people get caught up with thinking about a name and never even end up releasing a product. So I decided I would stick wth a domain I already had and build something. Two days later, I had.</p>

			<li>
				<h4>Who made Gumroad?</h4>				
				<p>I did. My name's Sahil Lavingia and you can read more about me by clicking that link in the footer. Put simply, I feel like shit when I'm not making stuff. Gumroad is just one of the many things I've built. There's much more to come so you should follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/slavingia/">Twitter</a> if that interests you.</p>
